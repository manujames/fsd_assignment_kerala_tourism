                    The name Wayanad is derived from Vayal Nadu which means the land of paddy fields. It is a picturesque plateau situated
                    at a height between 700 meters and 2100 meters above the mean sea level nested among the mountains of the Western Ghats
                    on the Eastern portion of North Kerala and on the sides of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka States. About 885.92 sq.km of area is under forest.
                    The culture of Wayanad is mainly tribal oriented. Comprising an area of 2,132 sq. kilometres, Wayanad has a powerful history.
                    Historians are of the view that organised human life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries before Christ. Countless evidences
                    about New Stone Age civilisation can be seen on the hills of Wayanad. The two caves of Ampukuthimala located between Sulthan Bathery and Ambalavayal,
                    with pictures on their walls and pictorial writings, speak volumes of the bygone era and civilisation. Recorded history of this district
                    is available from the 18th century. In ancient times, this land was ruled by the Rajas of the Veda tribe. In later days, Wayanad came under
                    the rule of the Pazhassi Rajahs of Kottayam royal dynasty. When Hyder Ali becames the ruler of Mysore, he invaded Wayanad and brought it
                    under his sway. In the days of Tipu, Wayanad was restored to the Kottayam royal dynasty. But Tipu handed over the entire Malabar region to the British,
                    after the Sreerangapattanam truce, he made with them. This was followed by fierce and internecine encounters between the British and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Rajah
                    of Kottayam. When the Rajah was driven to the wilderness of Wayanad, he organised the war-like Kurichiya tribals into a sort of people’s
                    militia and engaged the British in several guerrilla type encounters. In the end, the British could get only the dead body of the Rajah,
                    who killed himself somewhere in the interior of the forest. Thus, Wayanad fell into the hands of the British and with it came a new turn in
                    the Home of this area. The British authorities opened up the plateau for cultivation of tea and other cash crops. Roads were laid across
                    the dangerous slopes of Wayanad, from Kozhikode and Thalassery. These roads were extended to the cities of Mysore and Ooty through Gudalur.
                    Through the roads poured in settlers from all parts of Kerala and the virgin forest lands proved a veritable goldmine with incredible yields
                    of cash crops. When the State of Kerala came into being in November 1956, Wayanad was part of Kannur district. Later, south Wayanad was
                    added to Kozhikode district. In order to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Wayanad for development, north Wayanad and South Wayanad
                    were carved out and joined together to form the present district of Wayanad. This district came into being on
                    November 1, 1980 as the 12 district of Kerala.
