                    Bounded by the Nilgiris hills on the East and the Arabian Sea on the west, the district of Malappuram literally the
                    land atop the hills, is remarkable for its unique natural beauty. Perched among the undulating hills and the meandering
                    rivers that flow to reach the coconut-fringed seacoast, the land conceals a unique and eventful history.
                    The hill country also contributed much to the cultural artistic traditions of the state. The mosques and temples of the
                    land are known for their spectacular festivals. The land of great poets and writers, political and religious leaders,
                    the district has carved a unique place of its own in the history of Kerala. Home to the khilafath movement and the
                    mappila revolts, which questioned the British authority in India, Malappuram was the military headquarters of
                    the zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient times. Malappuram consist of 3 natural divisions, lowland, midland and highland.
                    The low land stretches along the sea coast, the midland in the centre and the highland region towards the East and
                    North eastern parts. The topography of the district is highly undulating; starting from the hill tops covered with
                    thick forest on the East along the Nilgiris, it gradually slopes down to the valleys and the small hills, before
                    finally ending on the sandy flat of luxuriant coconut groves in the west. The district has dry season from December
                    to February, hot season from March to May, the South west monsoon from October to November. The South west monsoon
                    is usually very heavy and nearly 75 percent of the annual rains are received during this season. The climate is
                    generally hot and humid; the range of temperature varying between 30 degree C and 20 degree C. the average 
                    annual rainfall is 290mm. Four important rivers of Kerala flow through Malappuram district. They are Chaliyar,
                    Kadalundippuzha, Bharathapuzha and Tirurpuzha. The district has a total forest area of 758.8684 Square km,out of
                    which 325.3261 Square km is reserve forests and 433.5423 Square Km is vested forests. The major forest area is
                    concentrated in Nilambur and Wandoor blocks and Melattur in the Western Ghats. Of the forests 80 percent is deciduous
                    and the rest is evergreen. Teak, Rosewood, Venteak, Choropin, Mahagony etc are the important trees. Other varieties like
                    Kulamavu and villa pine are used in the plywood industry. Bamboo hills extensively grown in all parts of the forest.
                    The district has also several man made plantations, mainly of Teak. Elephants, deers, tigers, blue monkeys, bears, boars,
                    rabbits etc are found in the forests along with variety of birds and reptiles. Forests are the main source of raw materials
                    for a number of wood-based industrial units. Besides timber, firewood and green manure, forest produces like honey, medicinal herbs,
                    spices etc are collected. The tribals collect minor forest produces. Bamboo for pulp factories is mainly supplied from Nilambur forests.
                    The forests are protected by two forest divisions-Nilambur north and Nilambur South. The social forestry division promotes planting of
                    trees outside forestlands, for protecting natural forests. About 50 Acres of Mangroves forest are spread over Kadalundi Estuary in
                    Vallikkunnu Grama Panchayath.
