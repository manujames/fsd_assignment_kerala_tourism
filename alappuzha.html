                    Alappuzha is a Land Mark between the broad Arabian sea and a network of rivers
                    flowing into it. In the early first decade of the 20th Century the then Viceroy
                    of the Indian Empire, Lord Curzon made a visit in the State to Alleppey, now Alappuzha.
                    Fascinated by the Scenic beauty of the place, in joy and amazement, he said,
                    “Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties”. In his exhilaration,
                    it is said, he exclaimed, “Alleppey, the Venice of the East”. Thus the sobriquet found
                    its place in the world Tourism Map. The presence of a port and a pier, criss-cross roads and
                    numerous bridges across them, a long and unbroken sea coast might have motivated him to make
                    this comparison. Alappuzha is well connected by waterways to various other parts of Kerala,
                    including the tourist destination of Kumarakom; and the district is itself a well known tourist
                    destination. The district is known for its Coir factories, as most of Kerala's coir industries are
                    situated in and around Alappuzha. The district is home to the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising against
                    the British and also the revolt against the Feudal raj. The name Alappuzha is derived from Aal (Sea) +
                    puzhai (River-mouth) ("The joining place of a river and the sea"). Alappuzha is one of the most important
                    tourist centres in the state, with a large network of inland canals. These large networks of canals are
                    Alleppey's lifeline. Alappuzha was one of the busiest centers of trade in the past, with one of the best-known
                    ports along the Malabar coast. Even today it retains its charm as the center for the Coir carpet industry and 
                    prawn farming. The Krishnapuram Palace is in Kayamkulam. The Buddha idol and Saradha Mandiram are the main
                    attractions of Mavelikkara. The Buddha statue is in a seated posture, resembling Padmasana.
                    A feature common to the idols is that hair has not been engraved on the head.
                    Alappuzha is also known for its snake-boat races held on the second Saturday of August, every year.
                    This competition; the Nehru trophy boat race takes its name from India's first prime minister Jawaharlal
                    Nehru, which was inaugurated in 1952. It is excitement all around as snake-boats, each manned by over a
                    hundred oarsmen, cut through the waters like wind. The event is a tremendous success with tourists and
                    the local population alike. The boat cruise along the backwaters of Alappuzha gives one a first hand
                    experience of the lifestyle; toddy tapping, fishing for small fry, Coir-making, prawn farming etc.,
                    which remains more or less unchanged over the years.
