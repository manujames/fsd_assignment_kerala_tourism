                    Kerala is a state on the southwestern coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956
                    by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile states of Travancore-Cochin and Madras.
                    Spread over 38,863 km<sup>2</sup>, Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state by area.
                    It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south,
                    and the Arabian Sea to the west. Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population.
                    It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being at Thiruvananthapuram.
                    Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Geography
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The state is wedged between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats.
                    Lying between northern latitudes 8°18' and 12°48' and eastern longitudes 74°52' and 77°22',
                    Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones.
                    The state has a coast of 590 km and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres.
                    Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions:
                    the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills,
                    and the western lowlands; coastal plains.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Climate
                </h5>
                <p>
                    With around 120–140 rainy days per year, Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced
                    by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon.
                    Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon,
                    and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Culture
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture.
                    However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development
                    of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions.
                    Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar,
                    a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala finds common usage in planning agricultural
                    and religious activities. Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official
                    language. Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Cuisine
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Kerala cuisine includes a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish,
                    poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are
                    characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day.
                    A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in one form or the other
                    (idli, dosa, puttu, pathiri, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada.
                    These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry,
                    egg masala and fish curry. Porotta and Biryani are also often found in restaurants in Kerala.
                    Thalassery biryani is popular as an ethnic brand. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam,
                    pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with
                    a cup of payasam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.
