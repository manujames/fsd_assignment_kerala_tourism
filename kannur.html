                    Kannur district is bounded by Kasaragod District to the north, Kozhikode district to the south, Mahé district to the
                    southwest and Wayanad District to the southeast. To the east, the district is bounded by the Western Ghats, which forms
                    the border with the state of Karnataka (Kodagu district). The Arabian Sea lies to the west. Paithalmala is the highest
                    point in Kannur District (1,372m). Enclosed within the southern part of the district is the Mahé district of the
                    Union Territory of Puducherry. Kannur district was ruled by the Chera dynasty as per the recorded-history, from
                    centuries before Christ till the medieval period, covered all of Kerala, Kanyakumari District and western Tamil Nadu.
                    The Mushika dynasty, also called the Nannans and later the Kolathiris, were relatives of the Cheras and ruled the
                    Kannur-Wayanad-Kasaragod area (Kolathunadu) as their regents. The Kannur region (Kolathunadu), as part
                    of Cheranaadu (Chera Kingdom), traded for several centuries with ancient Greece and Rome. Kannur was an important
                    trading center in the 12th century with active business connections with Persia and Arabia. It served as the British
                    military headquarters on India's west coast until 1887. In conjunction with her sister city, Tellicherry,
                    it was the third-largest city on the western coast of British India in the 18th century after Bombay and Karachi.
                    St. Angelo Fort was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. The Dutch
                    captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1663. They modernized the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia,
                    and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later.
                    A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.
                    The Dutch sold the fort to the king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772. The British conquered it in 1790 and used it as one of
                    their major military stations on the Malabar Coast. During the 17th century, Kannur was the capital city of the only
                    Muslim Sultanate in the Malabar region - Arakkal. During the British Raj, Kannur was part of the Madras province in the Malabar District .
