                    Kozhikode District was the capital of the erstwhile kingdom of the mighty Zamorins and once a renowned commercial center.
                    Endowed with lush green countrysides, serene beaches, historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, rivers, and hills, this city
                    enchants both its inhabitants and its guests. With its unique culture and friendly ambiance, Kozhikode is a wondrous
                    destination for all. The city of Calicut, the Anglicized form of Kozhikode, is the headquarters of the district.
                    The district of Kozhikode is bordered by Kannur district to the North, Wayanad to the East, and Malappuram to the South.
                    To the West, lies the mighty Arabian Sea. Lured by the spice trade, Phoenicians, Arabs and Chinese headed for its shores.
                    When Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498, he paved the way for the Dutch, the French and later the English.
                    As the major trading point of eastern spices, Calicut was known as the ‘City of Spices’.
                    The city was founded in 1042 AD. The word Calicut is derived from Calico, hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from Kozhikode.
                    Kozhikode was the capital of the Kingdom of Samoothiris or the Zamorin. The Samoothiri Kingdom became powerful among the kings of
                    Kerala due to the flourishing international trade. The Samoothiri Rajas were the arch enemies of the Rajas of Valluvanad.
                    Rather than being enraged by the loss of land and defeat in wars, the Valluvanad kings were incensed after their rights to
                    hold the Mamankam festival, held every 12 years, was usurped by their enemy. To avenge the insult, Valluvanad Kings used to
                    send an elite suicide squad called the Chaver Pada to assassinate the Samoothiri. In May 1498, Vasco da Gama arrived at the
                    head of a naval fleet, opening a new chapter in history. The British extended their sway over Kozhikode and rest of Malabar
                    after they defeated Tipu Sultan of Mysore. The district has a generally humid climate with a very hot season extending from
                    March to May. The rainy season is during the South West Monsoon, which sets in the first week of June and extends up to September.
                    The North East Monsoon extends from the second half of October through November. The average annual rainfall is 3266 mm.
                    The best weather is found in towards the end of the year, in December and January — the skies are clear, and the air is crisp.
